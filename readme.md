### Ara-Babam-Ara ###
Ara-Babam-Ara is a fetching tool for secondhand motor vehicles dealing web site [arabam.com](https://www.arabam.com) 

- You can the development version [here](https://caglarorhan.github.io/ara-babam-ara/) 

PS: Project failed to send notification if new items are added to the followed subcategories. Because, Notifications can only be called from Puhsh event or other Notifications click event. Due to this limitation no further planned development  needed. At this level you can see items, and they can be saved to the indexedDB.  

PS: messaging between service-worker and client side script would be a good lesson to take here.
